## Authentication

Our API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and Bearer tokens for API requests. You'll need to:

1. Create an application in the Developer Portal
2. Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Obtain access tokens
4. Include tokens in API requests

```bash
# Example API request with Bearer token
curl -X GET "http://192.168.1.181:4466/api/v1/employees" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
